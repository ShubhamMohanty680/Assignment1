The memory manager uses a reference counting system to track the number of references to objects in memory,    and frees the memory occupied by an object when its reference count reaches zero. Additionally, Python has a garbage collector that periodically frees up memory occupied by objects that are no longer being used. This ensures that Python programs are able to efficiently use memory without the need for manual memory management."
